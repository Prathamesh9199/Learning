==========================================================================

Module 2 - Python Environment setup

Commands
    - python -m venv .venv      ## to create a virtual Environment
    - python .\app.py           ## to run a python file
    - where python              ## to know where the python is installed on the system

Module 3 - AI Agents Deep Dive - A Full Overview

AI Agents
    - What?
        - System who has access to LLM, Environment, Tools
        - It uses LLM for understanding the context, building a plan to solve a problem, uses the tools to solve the problem, uses the Environment to perform the action of the tools.
        - Example: System with a Currency Conversion Tool, can use the LLM to know when to use it, use the Currency Conversion Tool within a sandbox Environment to do the conversion and get the answer, once the answer is received we can get back to user with it.
        - Exmple tools can be: Search the Web, Interact with SQL File, Access the SQL DB

        User Query --> LLM --> Tools --> Environment --> Tool answer --> LLM --> Agent Response

    - Why?
        - Having LLM is like having knowledge on how to cook a receipe, but without right tools & Environment it's not possible to actually cook something to eat.

Agents Characterstics
    - Autonomy (minimal human intervention)
    - Learning & adaption (via machine learning)
    - Interaction (with humans, systems via NLP, APIs)
    - Goal driven

Use Cases
    - Customer service chatbots
    - Personal assistance
    - Data analysis
    - Smart home system
